I've been learning to code now for about 9 months. In that time I've built a [Language Timesheet Web App](http://www.github.com/MisterOptimist/language_timesheet). I've learned how to get an [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) blog up and running and hosted on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com). I've also learned how to consult **Google** for pretty much any issue you ever have.

I feel like there is still a ton more to learn. Last weekend, I had this inner battle with myself on whether or not to try to install arch linux on my 2011 Macbook Pro and dual boot it with OSX. The Geek inside me wanted so badly to do it. I've never used Linux as my main OS, but I've had quite a bit of experience with it. My whole reasoning behind it was so I could learn more about how my system works. How the command line works. I want to learn Vim. I want to learn to setup my system *Exactly* how I want. However, I didn't want the hassel of trying to fix everything all the time when I'm already battling dozens of errors in my everyday workflow.

I made a compromise with myself. I was going to attempt to learn vim first. I want to learn to use what is arguably one of the most powerful text editors ever. I want to see if it does make me more productive. Or whether or not running a system dedicated pretty much to only the command line is attractive to me or not.

##This is my journey on switching to Vim

I learn by doing. I learn by getting my hands dirty and just accomplishing whatever the task is out before me. Previously I had been using [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com). It is truly a beautiful editor. It made me fall in love with writing code. From here on out though, I'll be sticking to strictly Vim. I am not using [Macvim](http://code.google.com/p/macvim/). I'm sticking to the basic of the basic. 

##Step 1.
I went through <code>vimtutor</code>. People really were not kidding when they said its an amazing resource. You learn all the basics and you even get to enable syntax highlighting. Which makes Vim 1000% better to look at. I learned enough in that 30 minutes to begin writing this post in vim. I gotta say, the markdown highlighting is loads better than Sublimes. Sublime didn't even have it built in. Anyway, I'm enjoying it so far. I'm forcing myself to use <code>h j k l</code> for movement. I've even installed a google chrome plugin called [Vimium](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en). Its *awesome*. It enables you to use vim-like commands in the browers on any website. I've found its helping me get accustomed to using the home row to navigagte around things. Being able to just type 3 letters to open up a link is extremely powerful.

Anyway, this is day 1. I'm loving it so far, and I don't feel frustrated. We'll see how it goes. I'll keep you updated. I'm sure the real fun will begin when I actually use it to edit ruby and rails code.
