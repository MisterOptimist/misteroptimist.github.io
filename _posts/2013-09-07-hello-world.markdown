Here is your obligatory *Hello World!* first post. I've been blogging for a few months over on Tumblr and decided to jump on the bandwagon with using Octopress/Jekyll for my blogging needs. In reality, I just wanted to get my hands dirty with it so I could learn a few things. I had some free time this weekend so I got it all setup.

For those of you who don't know, [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) is a *Simiple, Static Site Generator*. That means it transforms Plain text into static websites and blogs. This means I dont have to use **Tumblr** or **Wordpress**. And best yet, I can host it for free on Github. 

Anyway, I'm going to document my coding journey here. I've been coding for just under a year now and still learning. Here we go!
