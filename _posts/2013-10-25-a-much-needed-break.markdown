descripton: Why it is important to take breaks when learning to code.
---
I started learning to code at the beginning of January 2014. I feel like I inhaled pretty much every online resource I could think of. It got to the point where I felt smothered by all of the materials available. It kind of sounds like a good problem to have eh? Too many resources?


Anyway, my wife and I decided to go home for an early thanksgiving for our vacation time. We had been in Cambodia for over 1 year and 2 months. It was definitely time for a needed break. During that time, I told myself I wasn't going to work on any code or even blog. Its given me time to reflect on this past year. As I started thinking about it,  I thought I would write down a few cool things that have happened with the computer class.

1. We finally have a computer room! After a few months of trying to make it work, it finally came through and we have 4 working computers. Woo!
2. We expanded to two classes every day. The first hour being a smaller core group of students learning rails and the second hour being basic html and css.
3. Students are starting to take initiative on their own and trying to teach themselves javascript. (I guess this means I need to get around to learning it as well).

Progress is slow, but moving forward. That is what counts. Its crazy to think a the beginning of this year, I had no idea how to code anything up. Now we're getting students to launch their own web applications on heroku. Simple applications, but applications all the same.

I'm thankful for our 5 week rest. We still have a couple weeks to go before we head back and I'm going to enjoy the rest as much as I can. It really does one good to get up from the computer sometimes and just take a break. I'm someone who can just dive into something so much that I can get consumed. Its been nice to spend time with family and friends just relaxing. Its been so refreshing.

I'm looking forward to hitting it hard again though as soon as we get back.
