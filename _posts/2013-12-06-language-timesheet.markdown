[![Language Timesheet Application]({{ site.url }}/images/bblangteam.png)](http://www.bblanguageteam.com)

The organization I was working with needed a way to keep track of their staff's study hours for language. I had an idea to build a web application to help track everything. This is the fruit of that labor. It features a custom word of the day, timesheet tracking, and backend mangement for language staff.

This application is built off Rails 3 and designed with the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://www.getbootstrap.com) framework. 
Technologies include:
+Rails 3
+Twitter Bootstrap
+TDD with Rspec and Capybara
+Devise
+Public_activity
+Forem
